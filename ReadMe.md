# MinePico

This is a really short script that downloads and runs minecraft via a raspberry pi pico USB rubber ducky.
The play_minecraft.exe file is created from the minecraft_runner.py file with nuitka, which just utilizes [this](https://github.com/mindstorm38/portablemc/) to run the game. Huge thanks to mindstorm38 for making this project possible.
